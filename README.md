![Dish Decider][1] 

Dish Decider is a productivity tool designed to help working women decide their menu based on the ingredients available at their home. This quick web and mobile app saves time and allows the user to check ingredients list instead of typing them. Common items like salt, oil are assumed to be available.

The application scans through the entire database, making smart queries and returning the list of dishes the user can cook with the available ingredients. The user can then filter the results based on preparation time too.

The app is designed keeping in mind the multitasking woman of todayâ€™s world. They can login and add recipes to the website to help other women decide their dish of the day!

Conceptualized and developed by two sisters, we have seen our mother, our aunts and other ladies struggle with this everyday issue. By designing Dish Decider we aim to aid women in their petty tasks like deciding what to cook and how to cook it simply by entering the ingredients they have already.
